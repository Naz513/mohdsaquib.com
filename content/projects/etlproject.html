                            Ever since I got my AWS SAA certificates, I have been eager to challenge myself with
                            real-life projects. A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a challenge hosted by a cloud guru ,
                            and I did not wait for a second and jumped right in. It has been quite a lot of fun learning
                            and doing the project for the last few weeks, and I am excited to share it.

                            This project aimed to develop an ETL processing pipeline for COVID-19 data attained from the
                            New York Times and John Hopkins sources, using Python and various AWS cloud services. This
                            project incorporated the following AWS services:

                            To begin this project, I first visualized all the designs, so I have a clear idea of
                            approaching it. Below is my first mockup of the project. And following that is my final
                            Infrastructure Architecture.

                                    <p class="blog-para-content">The first part of the challenge was to make a static
                                        website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not want to spend too much time
                                        designing the website as this was a cloud challenge, so I went over to
                                        codepen.io and found a simple resume template. I later changed several sections
                                        and tweaked it to my liking, and added some JavaScript code to work with my API
                                        to display site visitors' count. This was the easiest part of the project.

                                        The first step of the project was to upload my front-end code to an S3 Bucket
                                        and then apply proper S3 Bucket Policies so the site's content cannot be
                                        accessed from anywhere else. I also had to do some management work on the S3
                                        Bucket to keep track of all the logs and enabled versioning. Finally, enabled
                                        website hosting feature available in S3, which turned my S3 Bucket into a web

                                        I was eager to show off my website to the public; however, the website displayed
                                        a randomly generated S3 website link. I wanted it to say my domain name instead.
                                        So, I purchased a domain name on Route53 and routed my S3 website link to my
                                        domain. This removed that random S3 URL and displayed my domain name instead. It
                                        was all coming together; however, the browser was showing my website as an
                                        "unsecured" website.

                                        I was not too fond of that, and I did not want my friends or colleagues to think
                                        my website was not secure or were prone to viruses. So, I went ahead and got a
                                        certificate in AWS ACM. I also did not want the contents of my website "Publicly
                                        Accessible". To fix this, I deployed my website using CloudFront, which is a
                                        fast content delivery network that securely delivers apps with low latency using
                                        its Edge Locations worldwide. Plus, it also provides AWS Shield protections for
                                        free against cyber-attacks. So why not? I went ahead and deployed my CloudFront
                                        distribution and routed it back to Route53 so it can be reaccessed through my
                                        domain. I implemented CloudFront Origin Access Identity, which allows S3 content
                                        to be only visible by CloudFront. In other words, my S3 content can only be
                                        accessed from CloudFront. At this stage, I was relieved to see as my browser was
                                        now showing the "Secure" lock sign next to my domain name.

                                        One of the main puzzles of this project was to implement a website visitor
                                        Counter. It was not as easy it seems to be as my main goal was to make it as
                                        serverless as possible. To tackle this challenge, I first learned how a DynamoDB
                                        NoSQL database works and how to design my database to store the counter. This
                                        was a straightforward part of the process. However, after looking at a few
                                        plans, I settled on the most straightforward implementation, which included
                                        having one item and an attribute, and all it would do is update the counter.

                                        The second step of this process was somehow to update my DynamoDB. I did not
                                        want to deploy an EC2 instance just to update the counter, which did not make
                                        any sense as I was going for a serverless architecture. The best way to handle
                                        this was by deploying a Lambda function, which would be triggered by an API
                                        gateway. It took me quite a while to work on my Lambda function as it was way
                                        more complicated than I thought it would be. I had to use AWS-SDK to make the
                                        function work with my DynamoDB table. It was still not quite working as I
                                        intended, so I worked on them one step at a time, and they were as follows:

                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            First, I deployed a simple Lambda function that would update my DynamoDB.
                                            This was simple and worked as expected.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> While working on my code, I updated my DynamoDB table's design quite a few
                                            times and then finally settled on the best and simple one.</li>
                                        <li> At this point, my Lambda Function was working with my DynamoDB by manual
                                            invocations. And now comes the hard part, it was to make an API trigger my
                                            lambda function and get back the response back to the API to display the
                                            content. I kept getting errors, and my Lambda function was just not
                                            returning any values back to my API. After countless tries and failures, and
                                            research, it turned out that I needed to produce my output in JSON format
                                            and had to pass in CORS in my function!</li>
                                        <li>And at last, it finally was working as intended, and the site visitor
                                            counter was working correctly.</li>

                                        At this point, I was content with my project. However, there was a problem.
                                        Every time I wanted to push new changed to my website, I had to go to the S3
                                        Bucket and manually upload the latest changes. This was such a tedious workflow
                                        and not efficient. I wanted to implement something where I could push code
                                        directly to my S3. It turns out there is a way! AWS CI/CD tools are an excellent
                                        service to handle this process. I could have done it with GitHub, but I wanted
                                        this entire project to be on AWS only. I implemented AWS Code Commit to store my
                                        code. And deployed AWS Code Deploy, which would use the artifacts in my
                                        repository from AWS Code Commit and push it to my S3 Bucket. However, this was
                                        not efficient enough as I still had to run these manually every time I had any
                                        updates. So, I added AWS Code Pipeline to take care of this automatically. After
                                        this, every time I made an update and pushed my code to the repository, after 10
                                        seconds, my AWS Code Pipeline would be triggered and push all the
                                        artifacts from my AWS Code Commit Repository to my S3 Bucket.

                                    <p class="blog-para-content">
                                        While I was working on my project, I discovered the power of Infrastructure as
                                        Code! I wanted to do the same with my project. I was fascinated by how it was so
                                        simple to create resources without even touching the AWS UI. So, I decided to
                                        take on this challenge and started learning it. CloudFormation is a great
                                        service offered by AWS, allowing developers to model and provision AWS and
                                        third-party resources using simple JSON and YAML. I decided to use YAML and
                                        spent about a week learning the basics of YAML and all the AWS intrinsic
                                        functions such as !Ref, !Sub, !Join, !GetAtt, and more. CloudFormation seems
                                        easy, but it's not, why do I say that? Because it's such a tedious work to keep
                                        on referring back to their Documentation. I had to incorporate several
                                        CloudFormation Keys and Values, such as Resources, Outputs, Parameters,
                                        Mappings, Metadata, in my project. I spent about a week writing my entire
                                        Infrastructure in YAML. The coolest thing about this was that my entire
                                        Infrastructure could be provisioned within 10 mins. Yes, that includes Deploying
                                        S3 buckets, working Lambda Function, DynamoDB, and creating certificates and
                                        rerouting them back to Route53. The hardest part of this step was creating the
                                        API in CloudFormation. It took me nearly two days to figure out how to implement
                                        my API in CloudFormation as there are several parts of an API which in the UI
                                        you don't see.

                            Working on this project was fun. I think I have a whole new appreciation for CloudFormation
                            and will be working on other projects that will be developed using CloudFormation. My next
                            goal is to develop more serverless apps and create a simple multi-tier application just for
                            fun. I will build it entirely in CloudFormation!
