                            Ever since I got my AWS SAA certificates, I have been eager to challenge myself with
                            real-life projects. A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a challenge hosted by a cloud guru ,
                            and I did not wait for a second and jumped right in. It has been quite a lot of fun learning
                            and doing the project for the last few weeks, and I am excited to share it.

                            project incorporated the following AWS services:

                                    run daily to fetch the latest data. I used Amazon EventBridge
                                    (Previously known
                                    as Cloudwatch Events Rule) to set up my cron job daily at 12:15 UTC. It
                                    was a
                                    simple task and was reasonably quick; however, I did not implement this
                                    feature
                                    until I had most of my lambda functions ready later in the process.</li>

                                    The next step of the project was to write a lambda code in Python, which would
                                    download both New York Times and John Hopkins data and save it in memory. This was
                                    relatively simple to implement. I used Pandas to take care of this and kept data in
                                    a data frame.

                                    In this step, I had to perform some data manipulations on the data downloaded
                                    from the sources mentioned above. First, I had to convert the date fields of
                                    both them to a Date object and not a string. Then combined both of the datasets
                                    by doing an inner join on the date using pandas. And finally, filtering all the
                                    non-US data from the John Hopkins dataset.

                                    While I was working through this step of the code, I found several instances where
                                    there were “NaN” data. To resolve this issue, I used another Pandas method,
                                    fillna(), and replaced it with a “0”.

                                    At first, I designed my project so that after it has downloaded the data, it would
                                    save it to an S3 bucket, and then an S3 event would trigger the transformation
                                    function. This was a tedious workflow and didn’t quite work well. However, as I
                                    progressed through the project, another step stated that the transformation code
                                    should not know where the code is stored, or it should know anything about databases
                                    and that it should be included as a python module. I made this entire task into its
                                    module and called it in my index python code. This made it reusable by other
                                    sections of the project.

                                    The next step of the project was to save the data somewhere. I decided to use
                                    DynamoDB as it’s a robust and super-fast NoSQL database. I used Boto3 to read,
                                    write, and update the transformed data into my database. I also implemented a
                                    mechanism to restrict itself from overwriting data based on the partition key if it
                                    already exists.

                                    I also implemented several errors handling mechanisms in this module. First, I
                                    verified if the date field is appropriately formatted and then confirmed if other
                                    fields are Integers and have values greater than or equal to 0, meaning there
                                    shouldn’t be any data with empty fields. If, for some reason, the code detects an
                                    error while running, the process will end and save the data in an S3 bucket.

                                    I implemented SNS to notify me if the process failed or passed. If it passed, it
                                    would tell me exactly how many rows were updated on a given day. If the operation
                                    failed, it would notify that the process failed and the row of that data where it
                                    failed and why.

                                    One of the main steps of this task was that if the code failed at any point, it
                                    should remember that it failed. And to take on this, I deployed another DynamoDB
                                    table that would solely keep track of the process. So, if my code for any reason
                                    fails midway, it would set the field in to “Failed = True.” And on the next run, my
                                    code would read this database to see my previous process's status. If the code
                                    failed previously, then the function would process the old data first, and after it
                                    has successfully loaded the data in, it would go ahead and process the latest data.
                                    If the previous process successfully went through, my lambda function would only
                                    process the latest data.

                                    To ensure the code could handle unexpected situations, I wrote a couple of tests
                                    using Python’s built-in test module, unittest. I have never written any tests
                                    before, so it was new to me. I spent a couple of hours learning and writing tests.
                                    It was pretty simple to implement. This helped me identify if any problems occurred
                                    to my main functions after updating them. I also added some of my custom data to
                                    test my primary functions.

                                    As you can see, the entire project is serverless and did not require any servers to
                                    run any of the processes. I used The Serverless Framework to write my infrastructure
                                    out. Why did I use The serverless Framework? Its because it is getting viral as the
                                    cloud industry is growing. It also emphasizes on serverless architecture and is
                                    super duper SIMPLE to use. Another reason was that it helped me package all of my
                                    python dependencies with a simple command. Not only that, but the serverless
                                    framework also allows other third-party dependencies that can be used in your
                                    serverless.yml. It is pretty much similar to writing CloudFormation templates with
                                    extra benefits. Another big reason why I chose this was that you could deploy your
                                    entire infrastructure with a simple command and delete it with another simple
                                    command.

                                    Oh, Boy! Where do I even start? Initially, I thought this would be the easiest step
                                    for this entire project. However, it did not turn that way. Initially, I planned to
                                    use AWS QuickSight to display my data in a dashboard, however mid-way through the
                                    project, I found out that DynamoDB isn’t supported with QuickSight yet. Bummer! I
                                    had to find another way to deploy my dashboard, so I then thought about using
                                    Tableau Public. However, there is no support for AWS to connect with Tableau Public
                                    version, its only available for the professional version, so that was out of the
                                    question. I did more research and found out that QuickSight works excellently with
                                    Amazon Athena. I had to restructure my code a little bit for this work. First, I
                                    changed my load function to save my data after being loaded to a Processed S3
                                    folder. After that, I implemented AWS Glue Crawler, which would pull in the S3
                                    Bucket data and put it inside the AWS Glue Database. Then from there, it was pretty
                                    straight forward; the data would automatically populate over to Athena. And in
                                    QuickSight, it was simple as clicking import data from Athena. Below is a static
                                    image of QuickSight Dashboard.
